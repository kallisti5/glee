Version

    Version 6, 2008/10/24

Number

    ARB Extension #56

Dependencies

    GLX 1.4 is required.

    Some of the capabilities of this extension are only available with
    contexts supporting OpenGL 3.0 or later.

Overview

    With the advent of new versions of OpenGL which deprecate features
    and/or break backward compatibility with older versions, there is a
    need and desire to indicate at context creation which interface will
    be used. This extension adds a new context creation routine with
    attributes specifying the GL version and context properties
    requested for the context. It also allows making an OpenGL 3.0
    or later context current without providing a default framebuffer.

New Procedures and Functions

    GLXContext glXCreateContextAttribsARB(
		    Display *dpy, GLXFBConfig config,
		    GLXContext share_context, Bool direct,
		    const int *attrib_list);

New Tokens

    Accepted as an attribute name in <*attrib_list>:

	GLX_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION_ARB		0x2091
	GLX_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION_ARB		0x2092
	GLX_CONTEXT_FLAGS_ARB			0x2094

    Accepted as bits in the attribute value for GLX_CONTEXT_FLAGS in
    <*attrib_list>:

	GLX_CONTEXT_DEBUG_BIT_ARB		0x0001
	GLX_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_BIT_ARB	0x0002

Additions to the OpenGL / WGL Specifications

    None. This specification is written for GLX.

Additions to the GLX 1.4 Specification

    Replace the initial six paragraphs of section 3.3.7 "Rendering
    Contexts", describing glXCreateNewContext, with:

   "To create an OpenGL rendering context, call

	GLXContext glXCreateContextAttribsARB(
			Display *dpy,
			GLXFBConfig config,
			GLXContext share_context,
			Bool direct,
			const int *attrib_list);

    If glXCreateContextAttribsARB succeeds, it initializes the context
    to the initial state defined by the OpenGL specification, and
    returns a handle to it. This handle can be used to render to any GLX
    surface (window, pixmap, or pbuffer) compatible with <config>,
    subject to constraints imposed by the OpenGL API version of the
    context.

    If <share_context> is not NULL, then all shareable data (excluding
    OpenGL texture objects named 0) will be shared by <share_context>,
    all other contexts <share_context> already shares with, and the
    newly created context. An arbitrary number of GLXContexts can share
    data in this fashion. The server context state for all sharing
    contexts must exist in a single address space.

    Direct rendering is requested if <direct> is True, and indirect
    rendering if <direct> is False. If <direct> is True, the
    implementation may nonetheless create an indirect rendering context
    if any of the following conditions hold:

      * The implementation does not support direct rendering.
      * <display> is not a local X server.
      * Implementation-dependent limits on the number of direct
	rendering contexts that can be supported simultaneously are
	exceeded.

    Use glXIsDirect (see below) to determine whether or not a request
    for a direct rendering context succeeded.

    <attrib_list> specifies a list of attributes for the context. The
    list consists of a sequence of <name,value> pairs terminated by the
    value None (0). If an attribute is not specified in <attrib_list>,
    then the default value specified below is used instead.

    <attrib_list> may be NULL or empty (first attribute is None), in
    which case all attributes assume their default values as described
    below.

    The attribute names GLX_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION_ARB and
    GLX_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION_ARB request an OpenGL context supporting
    the specified version of the API. If a version less than or equal to
    2.1 is requested, the context returned may implement any version no
    less than that requested and no greater than 2.1. If version 3.0 is
    requested, the context returned must implement exactly version 3.0.

       (Versioning behavior once GL versions beyond 3.0 are defined will
	be defined by amending this specification to define dependencies
	on such GL versions. It's possible that if version 3.N is
	requested and version 3.(N+1) is truly backwards-compatible, a
	3.(N+1) context could be returned. But we need to specify
	exactly what "backwards-compatible" means given the combination
	of deprecated features and forward-compatible contexts.)

    Querying the GL_VERSION string with glGetString (or the
    GL_MAJOR_VERSION and GL_MINOR_VERSION values with glGetIntegerv, in
    a 3.0 or later context) will return the actual version supported by
    a context.

    The default values for GLX_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION_ARB and
    GLX_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION_ARB are 1 and 0 respectively. This will
    typically return an OpenGL 2.1 context, if one is available.

    The attribute name GLX_CONTEXT_FLAGS_ARB specifies a set of flag
    bits affecting the rendering context.

    If the GLX_CONTEXT_DEBUG_BIT_ARB flag bit is set in
    GLX_CONTEXT_FLAGS_ARB, then a <debug context> will be created. Debug
    contexts are intended for use during application development, and
    provide additional runtime checking, validation, and logging
    functionality while possibly incurring performance penalties. The
    additional functionality provided by debug contexts may vary
    according to the implementation(fn). In some cases a debug context
    may be identical to a non-debug context.
	[fn: The ARB Ecosystem TSG is still defining the expected and
	required features of debug contexts.]

    If the GLX_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_BIT_ARB is set in
    GLX_CONTEXT_FLAGS_ARB, then a <forward-compatible> context will be
    created. Forward-compatible contexts are defined only for OpenGL
    versions 3.0 and later. They must not support functionality marked
    as <deprecated> by that version of the API, while a
    non-forward-compatible context must support all functionality in
    that version, deprecated or not.

    The default value of GLX_CONTEXT_FLAGS_ARB is 0.

    The attribute name GLX_RENDER_TYPE specifies the type of rendering
    to be supported by the context. RGBA rendering is supported if the
    attribute value is GLX_RGBA_TYPE, and color index rendering is
    supported if the attribute value is GLX_COLOR_INDEX_TYPE. The
    default value of GLX_RENDER_TYPE is GLX_RGBA_TYPE. OpenGL contexts
    supporting version 3.0 or later of the API do not support color
    index rendering, even if a color index <config> is available.

    On failure glXCreateContextAttribsARB returns NULL and generates an
    X error with extended error information. Conditions that cause
    failure include:

      * If the server context state for <share_context> exists in an
	address space that cannot be shared with the newly created
	context, if <share_context> was created on a different screen
	than the one referenced by <config>, or if the contexts are
	otherwise incompatible (for example, one context being
	associated with a hardware device driver and the other with a
	software renderer), BadMatch is generated.

      * If the server does not have enough resources to allocate the new
	context, BadAlloc is generated.

      * If <share_context> is neither zero nor a valid GLX rendering
	context, GLXBadContext is generated.

      * If <config> is not a valid GLXFBConfig, GLXBadFBConfig is
	generated.

      * If attribute GLX_RENDER_TYPE does not describe a valid rendering
	type, BadValue is generated.

      * If attributes GLX_CONTEXT_MAJOR_VERSION_ARB and
	GLX_CONTEXT_MINOR_VERSION_ARB, when considered together with
	attributes GLX_CONTEXT_FORWARD_COMPATIBLE_BIT_ARB and
	GLX_RENDER_TYPE, specify an OpenGL version and feature set that
	are not defined, BadMatch is generated.

	The defined versions of OpenGL at the time of writing are OpenGL
	1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0. Feature
	deprecation was introduced with OpenGL 3.0, so
	forward-compatible contexts may only be requested for OpenGL 3.0
	and above. Thus, examples of invalid combinations of attributes
	include:

	  - Major version < 1 or > 3
	  - Major version == 1 and minor version < 0 or > 5
	  - Major version == 2 and minor version < 0 or > 1
	  - Major version == 3 and minor version != 0
	  - Forward-compatible flag set and major version < 3
	  - Color index rendering and major version >= 3

      * If <config> does not support compatible OpenGL contexts
	providing the requested API major and minor version,
	forward-compatible flag, and debug context flag, GLXBadFBConfig
	is generated.

      * If an attribute or attribute value in <attrib_list>
	is not recognized (including unrecognized bits in bitmask
	attributes), BadValue is generated.

    3.3.7.1 Legacy Context Creation
    -------------------------------

    To create an OpenGL rendering context of version 2.1 or below, call

	GLXContext glXCreateNewContext(
			Display *dpy,
			GLXFBConfig config,
			int render_type,
			GLXContext share_list,
			Bool direct);

    Calling glXCreateNewContext is equivalent to the command sequence

	int attrib_list[] = {
	    GLX_RENDER_TYPE, render_type,
	    None
	};

	glXCreateContextAttribs(dpy, config, share_list, direct, attrib_list);

    A consequence of this behavior is that glXCreateNewContext cannot
    return a context of version 3.0 or greater. This ensures
    compatibility for existing applications, while mandating that
    3.0-aware applications use glXCreateContextAttribs to create a
    context.

    To determine if an OpenGL rendering context is direct, call..."


    In the description of glXMakeContextCurrent, replace the text

   "If either <draw> or <read> are not a valid GLX drawable, a
    GLXBadDrawable error is generated."

    with

   "If both <draw> and <read> are None, and the OpenGL version supported
    by <ctx> is less than 3.0, BadMatch is generated; if the OpenGL
    version is 3.0 or greater, the context is made current without a
    default framebuffer. The meaning of this is defined in chapter 4 of
    the OpenGL 3.0 Specification. If <ctx> is NULL and <draw> and <read>
    are not None, BadMatch is generated."

    Replace the text

   "To release the current context without assigning a new one, set
    <ctx> to NULL and set <draw> and <read> to None. If <ctx> is NULL
    and <draw> and <read> are not None, or if <draw> or <read> are set
    to None and <ctx> is not NULL, then a BadMatch error will be
    generated."

    with

   "To release the current context without assigning a new one, set
    <ctx> to NULL and set <draw> and <read> to None."

    After the sentence

   "The first time <ctx> is made current, the viewport and scissor
    dimensions are set to the size of the draw drawable (as though
    glViewport(0,0,w,h) and glScissor(0,0,w,h) were called, where <w>
    and <h> are the width and height of the drawable, respectively)."

    insert

   "If the first time <ctx> is made current, it is without a default
    framebuffer (e.g. both <draw> and <read> are None), then the
    viewport and scissor regions are set as though glViewport(0,0,0,0)
    and glScissor(0,0,0,0) were called."

GLX Protocol

    Two new GLX protocol commands are added.

    Send Extended Client Information To The Server (glXSetClientInfoARB)
    ----------------------------------------------

    This request is sent to the server during initialization, describing
    the GLX version, GLX extensions, GL version(s), and GL extensions
    supported by the client. The client needs to send only names of GL
    extensions that require server support, but must send all GLX
    extension names.

    When the server receives a GetString request, it uses this
    information to compute the version and extensions that can be
    supported on the connection. The GLX client library should append
    any client-side only extensions to the extension string returned by
    the GetString request. When the server receives a
    glXCreateContextAttribsARB request, it uses this information to
    determine whether the requested context version, attributes, and
    flags can be supported on the connection.

    glXSetClientInfoARB supersedes the glXClientInfo request. The client
    should send glXSetClientInfoARB only if GLX_ARB_create_context is
    present in the server's extension string; otherwise, glXClientInfo
    should be sent. If neither of these requests are ever sent to the
    server, the server assumes the client supports OpenGL major version
    1 and minor version 0, GLX major version 1, and minor version 0, and
    doesn't support any OpenGL or GLX extensions.

    Encoding:

	1      CARD8		     opcode (X assigned)
	1      33		     GLX opcode (glXSetClientInfoARB)
	2      6+(n0*2)+((n1+p1)/4)+((n2+p2)/4)    request length
	4      CARD32		     client GLX major version
	4      CARD32		     client GLX minor version
	4      n0		     number of context versions
	4      n1		     number of bytes in extension_string
	4      n2		     number of bytes in glx_extension_string
	n0*2*4 LISTofCARD32	     context versions
	n1     STRING8		     client GL extension string
	p1			     unused, p1 = pad(n1)
	n2     STRING8		     client GLX extension string
	p2			     unused, p2 = pad(n2)

    "Context versions" is a list of (major version, minor version)
    pairs; each pair describes a GL version supported by the client.
    Only the highest supported version below 3.0 should be sent, since
    OpenGL 2.1 is backwards compatible with all earlier versions. For
    example, a context versions array containing

	{ 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1 }

    Means that the client supports all GL versions between 1.0 and 2.1,
    as well as versions 3.0 and 3.1.

    If glXSetClientInfoARB is not sent by the client prior to context
    creation the server will behave as if no contexts above version 2.1
    are supported, and assume the client supports all GLX extensions.


    Context Creation with Attributes (glXCreateContextAttribsARB)
    --------------------------------

    This request is sent to create a context with specified attributes

Errors

    GLX errors for glXCreateContextAttribsARB as described in the
    body of the specification.

    glXMakeContextCurrent error behavior is relaxed to allow making an
    OpenGL 3.0 or later context current without a default read or draw
    framebuffer.

Issues

    All non-window-system dependent issues described in the
    WGL_ARB_create_context extension specification apply equally to
    GLX_ARB_create_context.

 1) Why was the context creation parameter <render_type> folded into the
    attribute list, while the parameters <direct> and <share_context>
    remains explicit?

    For <direct>, because different paths to the server may be taken for
    creating direct contexts, and parsing the attribute list in the
    client should not be required. For <share_context>, because putting
    a GLXContext, which is implemented as a struct pointer, into a list
    of 'int's does not work on LP64 architectures.

 2) What is the behavior when creating an indirect rendering context
    with attributes, flags, or a GLXFBConfig that require extensions not
    supported by the client GLX implementation?

    Context creation will succeed, but using such features may be
    impossible, since there may be no entry points defined in the client
    library to control them.
